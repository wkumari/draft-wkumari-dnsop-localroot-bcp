                Populating resolvers with the root zone
                draft-wkumari-dnsop-localroot-bcp-latest

Abstract

   DNS recursive resolver operators need to provide the best service
   possible for their users, which includes providing an operationally
   robust and privacy protecting service.  Challenges to these
   deployment goals include difficulty of getting responses from the
   root servers (such as during a network attack), longer-than-desired
   round-trip times to the closest DNS root server, and privacy issues
   relating to queries sent to the DNS root servers.  Resolvers can
   solve all of these issues by simply serving an already cached a copy
   of the full root zone.

   This document shows how resolvers can fetch, cache and maintain a
   copy of the root zone, how to detect if the contents becomes stale,
   and procedures for handling error conditions.

   This document obsoletes [RFC8806].

1.  Introduction

   DNS recursive resolvers have to provide responses to all queries from
   their clients, even those for domain names that do not exist.  For
   each queried name that is within a top-level domain (TLD) that is not
   in the recursive resolver's cache, the resolver must send a query to
   a root server to get the information for that TLD or to find out that
   the TLD does not exist.  Many of the queries to root servers get
   answers that are referrals to other servers.  But, research shows
   that the vast majority of queries going to the root are for names
   that do not exist in the root zone [DNEROOTNAMES].  Regardless of
   whether the queries get positive or negative answers, there are
   privacy implications related to the eavesdropping of these queries as
   they are transmitted to the DNS root servers.

1.1.  Local Caching of Root Server Data

   Caching the IANA root zone data locally, commonly referred to as
   running a "LocalRoot" instance, provides a method for the operator of
   a recursive resolver to use a complete copy of the IANA root zone
   locally instead of sending requests to the Root Server System (RSS).
   This goal can be implemented using a number of different
   implementation techniques, including as described in this document,
   but the net effect is the same: few, if any, queries should be sent
   to the actual RSS.

   Implementation mechanisms are documented herein for achieving
   LocalRoot functionality (see {#functionality}).  At a high level,
   this involves the LocalRoot implementation pre-fetch the root zone at
   regular intervals and populate its resolver's cache with information,
   or by running an authoritative server in parallel that acts as a
   local authoritative root server.  Other mechanisms for implementing
   LocalRoot functionality MAY be used.  To a client, the net effect of
   using any technique SHOULD be nearly indistinguishable to that of a
   non-Localroot resolver.

   Note that enabling LocalRoot functionality in a resolver should have
   little effect on improving resolver speed to its stub resolver
   clients for queries under Top Level Domains (TLDs), as the TTL for
   most TLDs is long-lived (two days in the current root zone).  Thus,
   most TLD nameserver and address records are typically already in a
   resolver's cache.  Negative answers from the root servers are also
   cached in a similar fashion, though potentially for a shorter time
   based on the SOA negative cache timing (one day in the current root
   zone).

   This behavior SHOULD be used by all general-purpose recursive
   resolvers used on the public Internet.

   Also note that a different approach to partially mitigating some of
   the privacy problems that a LocalRoot enabled resolver solves can be
   achieved using the "Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache"
   [RFC8198] functionality.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terminology defined in
   [RFC8499].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology used in this document

   *  IANA root zone: the Internet's unique DNS root zone as published
      by IANA [RFC2826].  This is the same source of root zone data used
      by the Root Server Operators [RSSAC055].  [RFC8499] describes the
      same root zone as "The zone of a DNS-based tree whose apex is the
      zero- length label.  Also sometimes called ''the DNS root'."

   *  IANA root zone data: the complete set of contents that makes up
      the IANA root zone.

   *  A LocalRoot enabled resolver: a recursive resolver that makes use
      of a local copy of the root zone data by any means possible.

   *  A LocalRoot implementation: the software or system of software
      responsible for implementing the functionality described in this
      specification.  Note that this may be done in a single piece of
      software, or a set of components, or even a set of systems as long
      as the functionality of a LocalRoot implementation behaves
      identically to a resolver that is not Localroot enabled.

3.  Components of a LocalRoot enabled resolver

   To implement the goals described in Section 1.1 and meet the
   requirements described in Section 4, a LocalRoot enabled resolver
   will need to perform three fundamental tasks:

   1.  Identify locations from where root zone data can be obtained
       Section 3.1.

   2.  Downloading and refreshing the root zone data from one of the
       publication points Section 3.2.

   3.  Integrating and serving the data while performing DNS resolutions
       Section 3.3

   This functionally entirely alleviates the need for sending any
   (other) DNS requests to the RSS.

   These steps may be implemented as a singular component within a
   recursive resolver or within multiple components operating in
   coordination.  Implementations may also vary significantly in how
   these tasks are performed, ranging from static configuration to more
   active systems.  We refer to this entire system, regardless of
   implementation sytle, as a the LocalRoot implementation.

   Each of these tasks are described in the subsections below.

3.1.  Identifying locations from where root zone data can be obtained

   For a LocalRoot enabled resolver to serve up to date data, an
   implementation must be able to fetch the contents of the entire IANA
   root zone on a regular basis from at least one publication source.
   Implementations can find sources of root zone data in a number of
   ways, including but not limited to:

   1.  An operationally configured list of sources (for example a file
       of URLs) that can be used to fetch a copy of the IANA root zone.

   2.  A list of sources distributed with the resolver software itself,
       (akin to how the root hints file is distributed with many
       resolvers today).

   3.  Downloading a list of available sources from the IANA using the
       sources described in
       [draft-hardaker-dnsop-iana-root-zone-publication-points].

   To support LocalRoot implementations wishing to implement option 3
   above, IANA will aggregate, publish and maintain a list of IANA DNS
   root zone sources at _TBD-URL_ (see
   [draft-hardaker-dnsop-iana-root-zone-publication-points]).  Guidance
   to IANA (or for other entities wishing to collect and redistribute a
   list of sources) for how to collect and maintain a list of IANA root
   data publication sources is discussed separately in
   [draft-hardaker-dnsop-root-zone-publication-list-guidelines].

3.2.  Downloading and refreshing root zone data

   For retrieving a copy of the IANA root zone from a list of IANA root
   zone publication points, a LocalRoot enabled implementation MAY be
   use the following steps.  Note that as long as the desired effect of
   performing normal DNS resolution remains stable when combined with
   LocalRoot functionality, other implementations MAY be used.

   If a local copy of the IANA root zone data is unavailable for use in
   DNS resolution at any point in these steps, resolvers SHOULD fall
   back to performing DNS resolution by issuing queries directly to the
   RSS instead.  If a resolver is unable to do so, it MUST respond to
   client requests with a SERVFAIL response code.

   The following steps are one way to achieve a LocalRoot
   implementation:

   1.  A LocalRoot implementation SHOULD use a list of root zone sources
       identified in Section 3.1 for obtaining a copy of the IANA root
       zone.

   2.  A LocalRoot implementation SHOULD select one of the available
       sources from step 1, and from it retrieve a current copy of the
       IANA root zone.  Resolvers SHOULD prioritize sources that can be
       fetched the most efficiently.  For example, when supported, https
       sources should be preferred as it allows for compression
       negotiation as well as the use of low-cost, well-distributed
       Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

       When sending requests to a source of IANA root zone data, the
       resolver SHOULD minimize its impact on the source by querying at
       a rate no faster than specified by the SOA refresh timer and
       SHOULD use data freshness protocol checks instead of downloading
       the entire contents at each refresh (example checks include the
       HEAD method [RFC9110] when using HTTP(s) or by querying the root
       zone's SOA over DNS first when using AXFR, IXFR or XoT).  Once
       fetched, an implementation MUST NOT make use of the obtained IANA
       root zone data with a SOA serial number less than any previously
       obtained copy [RFC1982].

   3.  If the LocalRoot implementation failed to retrieve the IANA root
       zone data in step 2, or the SOA serial number was deemed to be
       older than the already cached data, then it SHOULD attempt to
       retrieve the IANA root zone data from another source.  If the
       LocalRoot implementation resolver has exhausted the list of
       sources, it SHOULD stop attempting to download the IANA root zone
       data and SHOULD wait another refresh time length until retrying
       all of the sources again.

   4.  Having successfully downloaded a copy of the IANA root zone, the
       LocalRoot implementation MUST verify the contents of the IANA
       root zone data using the ZONEMD [RFC8976] record contained within
       it.  Note that this REQUIRES verification of the ZONEMD record
       using DNSSEC [BCP237] with the configured IANA root zone trust
       anchor.  The contents of the fetched zone MUST NOT be used until
       after ZONEMD verification, including its DNSSEC verification, is
       complete and successful.  Once the IANA root zone data has been
       verified, the LocalRoot implementation can begin LocalRoot
       enabled DNS resolution, potentially using the steps defined in
       Section 3.3.

   5.  The resolver MUST check at least one the sources in step 1 at a
       regular interval to identify when a new copy of the IANA root
       zone data is available.  This frequency MAY be configurable and
       SHOULD default to the IANA root zone's current SOA refresh value.
       When a resolver has detected that a new copy of the IANA root
       zone data is available, the resolver SHOULD start at step 1 to
       obtain a new copy of the IANA root zone data.  Resolvers MAY
       check multiple sources to ensure one source has not fallen
       significantly behind in its copy of the IANA root zone.

3.3.  Integrating and serving root zone data during resolution

   Any mechanism a LocalRoot implementation uses to integrate the IANA
   root zone obtained in Section 3.2 to perform DNS resolution tasks is
   sufficient if it is virtually indistinguishable to the DNS resolver's
   client.  Two example implementation strategies are included below.

3.3.1.  Pre-caching the root zone data

   Once the root zone data has been collected and verified as complete
   and correct (Section 3.2), a resolver MAY simply update its cache
   with the newly obtained data.

3.3.2.  Running a local authoratative copy of the root zone in parallel

   [RFC8806] described an implementation mechanism where a copy of the
   root zone could be run in an authoratative server running in parallel
   to the recursive resolver.  The recursive resolver could then be
   configured to simply point at this parallel server for obtaining data
   related to the root zone instead of the RSS itself.

   Note that [RFC8806] required that the parallel server be running on a
   loopback address, but this specification removes that requirement and
   allows the parallel service to run on any address it can legitimately
   be used on within its regular IPv4 and IPv6 address.  Such a server
   MUST NOT use an address of one of the official root server addresses
   in the root zone.

4.  LocalRoot enabled resolver requirements

   The following requirements are necessary when creating and/or
   deploying a LocalRoot implementation:

   *  A LocalRoot implementation MUST have a configured DNSSEC trust
      anchor as an up-to-date copy of the public part of the Key Signing
      Key (KSK) [RFC4033] or used to sign the DNS root or its DS record.

   *  A LocalRoot implementation MUST validate the contents of the root
      zone using ZONEMD [RFC8976], and MUST check the validity of the
      ZONEMD record using DNSSEC.

   *  A LocalRoot implementation MUST retrieve or be provisioned with a
      copy of the entire current root zone (including all DNSSEC-related
      records) (see Section 3.2).

   *  A LocalRoot implementation MUST be able to fall back to querying
      the authoritative RSS servers whenever the local copy of the root
      zone data is unavailable or has been deemed stale (see
      Section 3.2).

   *  A LocalRoot implementation MUST return records from the root zone
      without modification.

   *  A LocalRoot enabled resolver return identical answer content about
      the DNS root (or any other part of the DNS) as if it would if it
      were not operating as a LocalRoot enabled resolver.

   *  Resolvers MUST have an upper limit beyond which if a new copy of
      the IANA root zone data is not available it will revert to sending
      regular DNS queries to the RSS for performing DNS resolutions on
      behalf of its clients.  This upper limit value MAY be configurable
      and SHOULD default to the root zone's current SOA expiry value.
      Once the LocalRoot implementation's copy of the IANA root zone has
      been successfully refreshed and is no longer considered expired,
      the resolver may resume LocalRoot enabled resolution operations.

5.  Operational Considerations

   TBD

6.  Security Considerations

   There are areas of potential concern that are mitigated to some
   extent by using this mechanism.

6.1.  IANA root zone data security

   Secure DNS verification of an obtained copy of the IANA root zone is
   possible because of the use of the RSS's ZONEMD [RFC8976] record.
   This allows for the entire zone to be fetched and subsequently
   verified before being used within recursive resolvers resolvers.
   DNSSEC provides the same assurance for individual signed resource
   records sourced from the root zone, including of the ZONEMD record
   itself.

6.2.  Leakage of potentially sensitive information

   One privacy concern with the use of DNS is the leakage of potentially
   sensitive information that may be contained in the query name used in
   DNS queries.  Most root servers (except b.root-servers.net) do not
   currently support queries over encrypted transports, resulting in
   query names that are visible to on-the-wire eavesdroppers, and may
   also be held in any operational logs maintained by root server
   operators.  Such concerns may be mitigated by Query Name Minimization
   [RFC9156], but common implementations of this mechanism appear to
   only minimize query names of four or fewer labels, and the uptake
   rate of query name minimization appears to be quite low [QNAMEMIN].
   Furthermore, even with Query Name Minimization, queries for non-
   existent names (generated from keyword searches and mis-
   configurations) can cause additional privacy leaks.  [RFC8806]
   eliminates the need for the resolver to perform specific queries to
   any root nameserver, and obviates any such consideration of query
   name leakage [LOCALROOTPRIVACY].

6.3.  Local resiliency of the DNS

   Another issue solved with LocalRoot is that when information is
   always available locally, usage of it is no longer subject to DDoS
   attacks against the remote servers.  By having the answers
   effectively permanently in cache, no queries to the upstream service
   provider (such as root servers) are needed since [RFC8806] resolvers
   effectively always have a cached set of data that is considered fresh
   longer than the typical TTL records within the zone [CACHEME]
   [LOCALROOTPRIVACY].

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: describe the request for IANA to support a list of root server
   publication points at TBD-URL.

Acknowledgments

   The authors have discussed this idea with many people, and have
   likely forgotten to acknowledge and credit many of them.  If we
   discussed this with you, and you are not listed, please please let us
   know and we'll add you.

   This work has been founded upon previous documents.  Most
   importantly, [RFC8806], authored by Warren Kumari and Paul Hoffman,
   and "On Eliminating Root Nameservers from the DNS" [NOROOTS] by Mark
   Allman.

   The authors would like to thank Joe Abley, Vint Cerf, John Crain,
   Marco Davids, Peter Koch, Matt Larson, Florian Obser, Swapneel
   Patnekar, Puneet Sood, Robert Story, Ondrej Sury, Suzanne Woolf, and
   many many others for their comments, suggestions and input to both
   past and current versions of this document.

   In addition, one of the authors would like to once again thank the
   bands "Infected Mushroom", "Kraftwerk", and "deadmau5" for providing
   the soundtrack to which this was written.  Another author recently
   discovered the band "Trampled by Turtles" while working on this
   document and is submitting it as a nomination for the best-band-name-
   ever award.

History of the LocalRoot concept

   Note: DNSOP needs to discuss whether to publish this as a BCP or as a
   proposed standard.  Currently this is listed as STD track based on a
   number of preliminary conversations the authors had with both
   operators and IETF participants.

   [RFC8806] is an Informational document that describes a mechanism
   that resolver operators can use to improve the performance,
   reliability, and privacy of their resolvers.  This document concludes
   the concept of [RFC8806] was a success, but that actual
   implementation of it has varied according to the needs of various
   code bases and operational environments.  Thus, this document houses
   many of the original concepts of [RFC8806] but is largely a complete
   rewrite to match modern expectations based on recent implementation
   and deployment experiences.

   This document differs in a number of critical ways (TBD: this list is
   incomplete):

   1.  promotes the behavior in [RFC8806] to be either a Proposed
       standard or a Best Current Practice, depending on what the WG
       decides.

   2.  RECOMMENDS that resolver implementations provide a simple
       configuration option to enable or disable functionality, and

   3.  RECOMMENDS that resolver implementations enable this behavior by
       default, and

   4.  REQUIRES that [RFC8976] be used to validate the IANA root zone
       information before loading it.

   5.  Adds a mechanism for priming the list of places for fetching root
       zone data.

   6.  Adds protocol steps for ensuring resolution stability and
       resiliency.

An important change from RFC8806

   [RFC8806] Section 2 (Requirements) states that:

      The system MUST be able to run an authoritative service for the
      root zone on the same host.  The authoritative root service MUST
      only respond to queries from the same host.  One way to assure not
      responding to queries from other hosts is to run an authoritative
      server for the root that responds only on one of the loopback
      addresses (that is, an address in the range 127/8 for IPv4 or ::1
      in IPv6).  Another method is to have the resolver software also
      act as an authoritative server for the root zone, but only for
      answering queries from itself.

   This document relaxes this requirement.  Resolver implementations can
   achieve the desired behavior of directly serving the contents of the
   root zone via multiple implementation choices, beyond those listed in
   [RFC8806].  This can include the implementation guidance described in
   RFC8806, but this document allows for implementations to select any
   mechanism for fetching and re-distributing the contents of the root
   zone on their resolver service addresses as long as the other
   requirements specified in this document are still followed (see
   Section 4).

   For example, an implementation can simply "prefill" the resolver's
   cache with the current contents of the root zone.  As the resulting
   behavior is (essentially) indistinguishable from the mechanism
   defined in RFC8806, this is viewed as being an acceptable
   implementation decision.
