               Running a Root Server Local to a Resolver
                draft-wkumari-dnsop-localroot-bcp-latest

Abstract

   Many DNS recursive resolver operators wish to prevent snooping by
   third parties of requests sent to DNS root servers.  In addition,
   some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip
   times to the closest DNS root server; those resolvers may have
   difficulty getting responses from the root servers, such as during a
   network attack.  Resolvers can solve both of these issues by serving
   or pre-caching a copy of the full root zone on the same server or
   within the resolver software.

   This document shows how to fetch, cache and maintain such a copy of
   the root zone, how to detect if it becomes stale, and mechanisms for
   handling error states.  This specification is designed to increase
   the resiliency, privacy and efficiency of DNS resolver services.

   This document obsoletes RFC 8806.

   /* OLD abstract: RFC 8806 (often called "LocalRoot") defines a
   mechanism whereby a recursive resolver can fetch the contents of an
   entire IANA root zone and place this information into the resolver's
   cache.

   This has several benefits, including increased reliability, increased
   performance, improved privacy, and decreased or mitigation of the
   effect of some types of DoS attacks.

   While the majority of DNS resolver implementations natively support
   RFC 8806, it remains tricky to configure and maintain.  This document
   recommends that DNS resolver software simplify this configuration,
   and further suggests that configuration becomes the default.

   This document updates Section 2 of RFC8806 by relaxing the
   requirement that implementations MUST run an authoritative service.

   1.  I started writing this as rfc8806-bis, but as I did so I realized
       that it is likely better as a standalone document.

   2.  This document recommends ("Operation Considerations") using
       HTTP(S) for fetching the zone.  We still need to add text to
       cover priming and discuss the bootstrapping issue.  In addition,
       we need to add text about loadbalancing and fetching from
       multiple sources.  Much of the premise behind RFC8806 is that it
       doesn't matter where you fetch the zone from, as long as you
       validate it, and use zone checksums [RFC8976]. */

1.  Introduction

   DNS recursive resolvers have to provide answers to all queries from
   their clients, even those for domain names that do not exist.  For
   each queried name that is within a top-level domain (TLD) that is not
   in the recursive resolver's cache, the resolver must send a query to
   a root server to get the information for that TLD or to find out that
   the TLD does not exist.  Research shows that the vast majority of
   queries going to the root are for names that do not exist in the root
   zone.

   Many of the queries from recursive resolvers to root servers get
   answers that are referrals to other servers.  Malicious third parties
   might be able to observe that traffic on the network between the
   recursive resolver and root servers.


   Caching the root zone data locally, commonly referred to as
   "LocalRoot", provides "a method for the operator of a recursive
   resolver to have a complete IANA root zone locally, and to hide
   queries for the IANA root zone from outsiders.  The basic idea of a
   LocalRoot resolver is to create and maintain an up-to-date IANA root
   zone cache, and use that information when the recursive resolver
   looks up root information.  This can be implemented using a number of
   different techniques, but the net effect is the same: few, if any,
   queries are sent to the actual DNS root zone.

   Note that enabling LocalRoot in a resolver will probably have little
   effect on getting faster responses to the stub resolver for good
   queries on TLDs, because the TTL for most TLDs is usually long-lived
   (on the order of a day or two) and thus are usually already in the
   resolver's cache.  Negative answers from the root servers are also
   cached in a similar fashion, though potentially for a shorter time.

   Two potential mechanisms are documented herein for achieving
   LocalRoot functionality: having the resolver pre-fetch the root zone
   at regular intervals and pre-populate its cache with information, or
   by running an authoritative server in parallel and pointing the
   recursive resolver at this server's IP address as the source of root
   zone data.  The net effect of using either of these techniques should
   be nearly indistinguishable to that of a non-Localroot resolver to a
   client.

   A different approach to partially mitigating some of the problems
   that a LocalRoot resolver solves can be achieved using "Aggressive
   Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache" [RFC8198] functionality.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with [RFC8499].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Making RFC8806 behavior be a Best Current Practice

   [RFC8806] is an Informational document that describes a mechanism
   that resolver operators can use to improve the performance,
   reliability, and privacy of their resolvers.  This document concludes
   the experiment [RFC8806] was a success.  The reality is that secure
   DNS resolution using a local copy of the IANA root zone is possible
   because technologies like DNSSEC and ZONEMD [RFC8976] allow for the
   contents to be fetched from any location and subsequently verified
   and used within validating resolvers.

   This document:

   1.  promotes the behavior in [RFC8806] to be a Best Current Practice.

   2.  RECOMMENDS that resolver implementations provide a simple
       configuration option to enable or disable functionality, and

   3.  RECOMMENDS that resolver implementations enable this behavior by
       default. and

   4.  REQUIRES that [RFC8976] be used to validate the IANA root zone
       information before loading it.

   5.  Adds a mechanism for priming the list of places for fetching root
       zone data.

   6.  Adds protocol steps for ensuring resolution stability and
       resiliency.

4.  Changes from RFC8806

   [RFC8806] Section 2 (Requirements) states that:

      The system MUST be able to run an authoritative service for the
      root zone on the same host.  The authoritative root service MUST
      only respond to queries from the same host.  One way to assure not
      responding to queries from other hosts is to run an authoritative
      server for the root that responds only on one of the loopback
      addresses (that is, an address in the range 127/8 for IPv4 or ::1
      in IPv6).  Another method is to have the resolver software also
      act as an authoritative server for the root zone, but only for
      answering queries from itself.

   This document relaxes this requirement.  Resolver implementations can
   achieve the desired behavior of directly serving the contents of the
   root zone via multiple implementation choices, beyond those listed in
   [RFC8806].  This can include what is described in RFC8806, but this
   document allows for implementations to select any mechanism for
   fetching and re-distributing the contents of the root zone on their
   resolver service addresses.  For example, this can be done by simply
   "prefilling" the resolver's cache with the contents of the root zone.
   As the resulting behavior is (essentially) indistinguishable from the
   mechanism defined in RFC8806, this is viewed as being an acceptable
   implementation decision.  In the end, the fundamental requirement is
   simply: resolvers MUST return the records from the root zone without
   modification.

5.  Applicability

   This behavior should apply to all general-purpose recursive resolvers
   used on the public Internet.

6.  Resolver Requirements

   In order to implement the mechanism described in this document:

   *  The system MUST be able to validate the contents of the root zone
      using ZONEMD [RFC8976], which also requires supporting DNSSEC for
      verifying the root zone's ZONEMD record.

   *  The system MUST have an up-to-date copy of the public part of the
      Key Signing Key (KSK) [RFC4033] used to sign the DNS root.

   *  The system MUST be able to retrieve a copy of the entire root zone
      (including all DNSSEC-related records) Section 7.2.

   *  The system MUST be able to fall back to querying the authoritative
      root servers whenever the local copy of the root zone data is
      unavailable or has been deemed stale Section 7.2.

   A corollary of the above list is that a resolver running LocalRoot
   MUST return equivalent answers about the DNS root or any other part
   of the DNS as if it was not operating as a LocalRoot.

7.  Functionality of a LocalRoot enabled resolver

   The functionality of LocalRoot enabled resolver includes:

   1.  Consulting the list of publication points for DNS root zone data
       Section 7.1.

   2.  Downloading and refreshing the root zone data from a publication
       point Section 7.2.

   3.  Integrating and serving the data while performing DNS resolutions
       Section 8

7.1.  Consulting the list of IANA DNS root data publication points

   In order for the [RFC8806] mechanism to be effective, a resolver must
   be able to fetch the contents of the entire IANA root zone.

   IANA will maintain and publish a list of IANA DNS root zone sources
   at TBD-URL.  This list of "IANA root zone data publication points"
   may be used when downloading and refreshing the root zone data, as
   described in Section 7.2.  Specifically, the IANA DNS root zone
   publication list can be used by the resolver software directly, by
   the operating system, by a network operator when configuring a
   resolver.

   The contents of the IANA DNS root publication points file MUST be
   verified as to its integrity as having come from IANA and MUST be
   verified as complete.

   The format of the IANA root zone data publication points list will be
   a newline delimited file of URLs [RFC2056].  URLs in the list may
   include any protocol capable of transferring DNS zone data, including
   AXFR [RFC5936], HTTPS [RFC9110], etc.

   Any URLs that reference an unknown transfer protocol SHOULD be
   discarded.  If after filtering the list there are no acceptable list
   elements left, the resolver MUST revert to using regular DNS queries
   to the IANA root zone instead of operating as a LocalRoot.

   (ED: likely drop or move ) This is currently usually performed
   through AXFR ([RFC5936]) and MAY continue doing so.  Resolvers also
   MAY allow fetching this information via HTTPS.  Where possible, HTTPS
   should be preferred as it allows for compression negotiation as well
   as the possibility of using low-cost, well-distributed CDNs to
   distribute the zone files.

7.2.  Protocol steps

   When initializing a resolvers' [RFC8806] mechanism, the following
   steps MAY be used to implement the LocalRoot functionality.  Note
   that as long as the desired effect of performing normal DNS
   resolution remains stable when combined with LocalRoot functionality,
   other implementations MAY be used.

   1.  The resolver should use one of the following sources to obtain a
       list of locations where the current IANA root zone may be
       available from:

       a.  Use a locally configured list of sources from which to fetch
       a copy of the IANA root zone.  b.  Use a list of sources
       distributed with the resolver software itself.  c.  Download a
       copy of available sources from the IANA using the sources
       describe in Section 7.1.

   2.  The resolver MUST select one of the available sources from step
       1, and from it retrieve a current copy of the IANA root zone.

   3.  If the resolver failed to retrieve the IANA root zone content in
       step 2, and there are other available sources from available
       sources from step 1, it SHOULD attempt to retrieve the IANA root
       zone from that list.  If the resolver has exhausted the list of
       sources, it SHOULD stop attempting to download the IANA root zone
       and MUST fall back to using regular DNS mechanisms for performing
       DNS resolutions.  Upon a failure, but before exhausting the list
       of available IANA root zone sources, the resolver MAY choose to
       cease attempting download the IANA root zone and if so it MUST
       fall back to using regular DNS mechanisms for performing DNS
       resolutions.

   4.  Having successfully downloaded a copy of the IANA root zone, the
       resolver MUST verify the contents of the IANA root zone using the
       ZONEMD [RFC8976] record contained within it.  Note that this
       REQUIRES verification of the ZONEMD record using DNSSEC [BCP237]
       and the configured root key trust anchor.  Once the zone data has
       been verified as being the IANA root zone, the resolver can begin
       operation using the steps defined in [RFC8806] can be followed.
       The contents of the fetched zone MUST NOT be used until after
       ZONEMD verification is complete and successful.

   /* ED(WH): I think this must be a biz and actually replace 8806,
   because other 8806 is an experimental protocol still */

   1.  The resolver MUST check the sources in step 1 at a regular
       interval to identify when a new copy of the IANA root zone is
       available.  This internal MAY be configurable and SHOULD default
       to 1 hour.  When a resolver has detected that a new copy of the
       IANA root zone is available, the resolver should consider its
       copy stale and MUST start at step 1 to obtain a new zone.
       Resolvers MAY check multiple sources to ensure one source has not
       fallen significantly behind in its copy of the IANA root zone.
       Resolvers MUST have an upper limit beyond which if a new copy is
       not available it will revert to using regular DNS queries to the
       IANA root zone instead of continuing to use the previously
       downloaded copy.  This upper limit stale value MAY be
       configurable and SHOULD default to 1 day.  Once the stale timer
       has been reached, the resolver may resume [RFC8806] operations
       once a fresh copy can be obtained after restarting at step 1.

7.3.  Integrating root zone data into the resolution process

8.  Operational Considerations

   /* ED (WH): I don't think we can get away without describing how/
   where to pull this information from at some point.  The ICANN https
   servers are one source, or should resolver code bases use their own
   defined CDNs?

   (WK): 100% agree.  I personally think that this should be hosted on
   multiple CDNs, and that expecting a single server or service to
   always be available would be a massive mistake.  But, I also don't
   think that resolvers should pull from their own CDNs - I don't want
   Acme Anvil and Resolvers (or their CDN!) go out of business, and have
   Acme Resolvers fail.  This is (I believe) a sufficiently small amount
   of data that hosting it on multiple CDNs should be trivial.... but, I
   also believe that this topic should be discussed with the WG. */

   /* Ed (WK): We might want to add some more discussions around failure
   handling, but, 1: [RFC8806] already covers much of this and 2: "don't
   teach your grandmother to suck eggs" - implementations already handle
   this, so let's not try to overspecify or over-constrain what they do.
   */

9.  Security Considerations

   There are areas of potential concern that are mitigated to some
   extent by using this mechanism.

   The issue of leakage of potentially sensitive information that may be
   contained in the query name used in DNS queries.  Most root servers
   (except b.root-servers.net) do not currently support queries over
   encrypted transports, resulting in query names that are visible to
   on-the-wire eavesdroppers, and may also be held in any operational
   logs maintained by root server operators.  Such concerns may be
   mitigated by Query Name Minimization [RFC9156], but common
   implementations of this mechanism appear to only minimize query names
   of four or fewer labels, and the uptake rate of query name
   minimization appears to be quite low [QNAMEMIN].  Furthermore, even
   with Query Name Minimization, queries for non-existent names
   (generated from keyword searches and mis-configurations) can cause
   additional privacy leaks.  [RFC8806] eliminates the need for the
   resolver to perform specific queries to any root nameserver, and
   obviates any such consideration of query name leakage
   [LOCALROOTPRIVACY].

   The final issue solved with LocalRoot is that when information is
   always available locally, usage of it is no longer subject to DDoS
   attacks against the remote servers.  By having the answers
   effectively permanently in cache, no queries to the upstream service
   provider (such as root servers) are needed since [RFC8806] resolvers
   effectively always have a cached set of data that is considered fresh
   longer than the typical TTL records within the zone [CACHEME]
   [LOCALROOTPRIVACY].

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Acknowledgments

   The authors have discussed this idea with many people, and have
   likely forgotten to acknowledge and credit many of them.  If we
   discussed this with you, and you are not listed, please please let us
   know and we'll add you.

   The authors would like to thank Joe Abley, Vint Cerf, John Crain,
   Marco Davids, Paul Hoffman, Peter Koch, Matt Larson, Florian Obser,
   Swapneel Patnekar, Puneet Sood, Robert Story, Ondrej Sury, Suzanne
   Woolf, and many many others for their comments, suggestions and
   input.

   In addition, one of the authors would like to once again thank the
   bands "Infected Mushroom", "Kraftwerk", and "deadmau5" for providing
   the soundtrack to which this was written.  Another author recently
   discovered the band "Trampled by Turtles" and has submitted it as a
   nomination for the best-band-name-ever award.

Appendix A: Example Configurations

   These examples are provided to show how the LocalRoot mechanism can
   be configured in various resolver implementations.  They are not
   intended to be exhaustive, and may not work with all versions of the
   software.

   /* Ed (WK): These examples are just to get started.  We would
   appreciate contributions from the resolver operators.

   Yes, we are fully aware of the circular dependency of trying to
   resolve e.g www.internic.net when bootstrapping.  More discussion on
   serving the IANA root zone over HTTP by IP will be added later. */

ISC BIND 9.14 and above

   See the BIND documentation for mirror zones
   (https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#namedconf-
   statement-type%20mirror).

   Example configuration using a "mirror" zone:

   zone "." {
       type mirror;
   };

Knot Resolver

   See the Knot Resolver Cache prefilling (https://knot-
   resolver.readthedocs.io/en/v5.0.1/modules-
   prefill.html?highlight=cache%20prefilling) documentation for more
   information.

   The following example configuration will prefill the IANA root zone
   using HTTPS:

 modules.load('prefill')
 prefill.config({
       ['.'] = {
               url = 'https://www.internic.net/domain/root.zone',
               interval = 86400  -- seconds
               ca_file = '/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt', -- optional
       }
 })

Unbound 1.9 and above

   See the Unbound documentation for Authority Zone Options
   (https://unbound.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/manpages/
   unbound.conf.html#unbound-conf-auth-url) configuration.

   The following example configuration will prefill the IANA root zone
   using HTTPS:

   auth-zone:
       name: "."
       url: "https://www.internic.net/domain/root.zone"
       zonefile: "root.zone"
       fallback-enabled: yes
       for-downstream: no
       for-upstream: yes
       zonefile: "root.zone"
