                Populating resolvers with the root zone.
                draft-wkumari-dnsop-localroot-bcp-latest

Abstract

   DNS recursive resolver operators need to provide the best service
   possible for their users, which includes providing an operationally
   robust and privacy protecting service.  Challenges to these
   deployment goals include difficulty of getting responses from the
   root servers (such as during a network attack), longer-than-desired
   round-trip times to the closest DNS root server, and privacy issues
   relating to queries sent to the DNS root servers.  Resolvers can
   solve all of these issues by simply serving an already cached a copy
   of the full root zone.

   This document shows how resolvers can fetch, cache and maintain a
   copy of the root zone, how to detect if the contents becomes stale,
   and procedures for handling error conditions.

   This document obsoletes [RFC8806].

1.  Introduction

   DNS recursive resolvers have to provide answers to all queries from
   their clients, even those for domain names that do not exist.  For
   each queried name that is within a top-level domain (TLD) that is not
   in the recursive resolver's cache, the resolver must send a query to
   a root server to get the information for that TLD or to find out that
   the TLD does not exist.  Many of the queries from recursive resolvers
   to root servers get answers that are referrals to other servers.
   But, research shows that the vast majority of queries going to the
   root are for names that do not exist in the root zone [DNEROOTNAMES].
   There are privacy implications for queries that can be observed by
   malicious third parties for both the queries for names that do exist
   and for the names that do not exist.

1.1.  Local Caching of Root Server Data

   Caching the root zone data locally, commonly referred to as running a
   "LocalRoot" instance, provides a method for the operator of a
   recursive resolver to use a complete copy of the IANA root zone
   locally instead of sending requests to the Root Server System (RSS).
   This technique can be implemented using a number of different
   implementation techniques, including as described in this document,
   but the net effect is the same: few, if any, queries should be sent
   to the actual RSS.

   Two potential implementation mechanisms are documented herein for
   achieving LocalRoot functionality: by having the resolver pre-fetch
   the root zone at regular intervals and populate its cache with
   information, or by running an authoritative server in parallel with
   the recursive resolver that acts as a local authoritative root
   server.  Other mechanisms for implementing LocalRoot functionality
   MAY be used.  To a client, the net effect of using any technique
   SHOULD be nearly indistinguishable to that of a non-Localroot
   resolver.

   Note that enabling LocalRoot functionality in a resolver should have
   little effect on improving resolver speed to its stub resolver
   clients for queries under Top Level Domains (TLDs), as the TTL for
   most TLDs is long-lived (two days in the current root zone).  Thus,
   most TLD nameserver and address records are typically already in a
   resolver's cache.  Negative answers from the root servers are also
   cached in a similar fashion, though potentially for a shorter time
   based on the SOA negative cache timing (one day in the current root
   zone).

   Also note that a different approach to partially mitigating some of
   the privacy problems that a LocalRoot enabled resolver solves can be
   achieved using the "Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache"
   [RFC8198] functionality.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terminology defined in
   [RFC8499].

   This behavior SHOULD be used by all general-purpose recursive
   resolvers used on the public Internet.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology used in this document

   *  IANA root zone: the DNS root zone as published by IANA.  [RFC8499]
      describes the same root zone as "The zone of a DNS-based tree
      whose apex is the zero- length label.  Also sometimes called ''the
      DNS root'."

   *  A LocalRoot enabled resolver: a recursive resolver that makes use
      of a local copy of the root zone data by any means possible.

   *  A LocalRoot implementation: the software or system of software
      responsible for implementing the functionality described in this
      specification.  Note that this may be done in a single piece of
      software, or a set of components, or even a set of systems as long
      as the functionality of a LocalRoot implementation behaves
      identically to a resolver that is not Localroot enabled.

3.  Making LocalRoot functionality the recommended practice

   (Ed: this section is primarily here to drive discussion within IETF
   WGs of interest and will be removed (or its text moved) prior to
   publication, with the possible exception of the list of differences
   between this document and RFC8806)

   Note: DNSOP needs to discuss whether to publish this as a BCP or as a
   proposed standard.  Currently this is listed as STD track based on a
   number of preliminary conversations the authors had with both
   operators and IETF participants.

   [RFC8806] is an Informational document that describes a mechanism
   that resolver operators can use to improve the performance,
   reliability, and privacy of their resolvers.  This document concludes
   the concept of [RFC8806] was a success, but that actual
   implementation of it has varied according to the needs of various
   code bases and operational environments.

   Secure DNS verification of an obtained copy of the IANA root zone is
   possible because of the use of the RSS's ZONEMD [RFC8976] record.
   This allows for the entire zone to be fetched and subsequently
   verified before being used within recursive resolvers resolvers.
   DNSSEC provides the same assurance for individual signed resource
   records sourced from the root zone, including of the ZONEMD record
   itself.

   This document:

   1.  promotes the behavior in [RFC8806] to be either a Proposed
       standard or a Best Current Practice, depending on what the WG
       decides.

   2.  RECOMMENDS that resolver implementations provide a simple
       configuration option to enable or disable functionality, and

   3.  RECOMMENDS that resolver implementations enable this behavior by
       default, and

   4.  REQUIRES that [RFC8976] be used to validate the IANA root zone
       information before loading it.

   5.  Adds a mechanism for priming the list of places for fetching root
       zone data.

   6.  Adds protocol steps for ensuring resolution stability and
       resiliency.

   (ed note: should we require checking the SOA serial number for
   increasing values in #4, and down below in localroot enabled resolver
   requirements?)

4.  LocalRoot enabled resolver requirements

   In order to implement the functionality described in this document:

   *  A LocalRoot implementation MUST have a configured DNSSEC trust
      anchor as an up-to-date copy of the public part of the Key Signing
      Key (KSK) [RFC4033] or used to sign the DNS root or its DS record.

   *  A LocalRoot implementation MUST validate the contents of the root
      zone using ZONEMD [RFC8976], and MUST check the validity of the
      ZONEMD record using DNSSEC.

   *  A LocalRoot implementation MUST retrieve or be provisioned with a
      copy of the entire current root zone (including all DNSSEC-related
      records) (see Section 5.2).

   *  A LocalRoot implementation MUST be able to fall back to querying
      the authoritative RSS servers whenever the local copy of the root
      zone data is unavailable or has been deemed stale (see
      Section 5.2).

   *  A LocalRoot implementation MUST return records from the root zone
      without modification.

   *  A LocalRoot enabled resolver return identical answer content about
      the DNS root (or any other part of the DNS) as if it would if it
      were not operating as a LocalRoot enabled resolver.

4.1.  Important change from RFC8806

   [RFC8806] Section 2 (Requirements) states that:

      The system MUST be able to run an authoritative service for the
      root zone on the same host.  The authoritative root service MUST
      only respond to queries from the same host.  One way to assure not
      responding to queries from other hosts is to run an authoritative
      server for the root that responds only on one of the loopback
      addresses (that is, an address in the range 127/8 for IPv4 or ::1
      in IPv6).  Another method is to have the resolver software also
      act as an authoritative server for the root zone, but only for
      answering queries from itself.

   This document relaxes this requirement.  Resolver implementations can
   achieve the desired behavior of directly serving the contents of the
   root zone via multiple implementation choices, beyond those listed in
   [RFC8806].  This can include the implementation guidance described in
   RFC8806, but this document allows for implementations to select any
   mechanism for fetching and re-distributing the contents of the root
   zone on their resolver service addresses as long as the other
   requirements specified in this document are still followed (see
   Section 4).

   For example, an implementation can simply "prefill" the resolver's
   cache with the current contents of the root zone.  As the resulting
   behavior is (essentially) indistinguishable from the mechanism
   defined in RFC8806, this is viewed as being an acceptable
   implementation decision.

5.  Functionality of a LocalRoot enabled resolver

   To implement the goals described in Section 1.1 and meet the
   requirements described in Section 4, a LocalRoot enabled resolver
   will need to perform three fundamental tasks:

   1.  Identify locations from where root zone data can be obtained
       Section 5.1.

   2.  Downloading and refreshing the root zone data from one of the
       publication points Section 5.2.

   3.  Integrating and serving the data while performing DNS resolutions
       Section 5.3, Paragraph 1

   Each of these are described in the subsections below.  Note that
   implementations may vary significantly in how these tasks are
   performed, ranging from static configuration to more active systems.

5.1.  Identifying locations from where root zone data can be obtained

   For a LocalRoot enabled resolver to serve up to date data, an
   implementation must be able to fetch the contents of the entire IANA
   root zone on a regular basis from at least one publication source.
   Implementations can find sources of root zone data in a number of
   ways, including but not limited to:

   1.  An operationally configured list of sources (for example a file
       of URLs) that can be used to fetch a copy of the IANA root zone.

   2.  A list of sources distributed with the resolver software itself,
       (akin to how the root hints file is distributed with many
       resolvers today).

   3.  Downloading a list of available sources from the IANA using the
       sources described in Section 6.

   To support LocalRoot implementations, IANA will aggregate, publish
   and maintain a list of IANA DNS root zone sources at _TBD-URL_
   Section 6.  Guidance to IANA (or for other entities wishing to
   collect and redistribute a list of sources) for how to collect and
   maintain a list of IANA root data publication sources is discussed
   separately in
   [draft-hardaker-dnsop-root-zone-publication-list-guidelines].

5.2.  Downloading and refreshing root zone data

   When retrieving a copy of the IANA root zone from a list of IANA root
   zone publication points, a LocalRoot enabled implementation MAY be
   use the following steps.  Note that as long as the desired effect of
   performing normal DNS resolution remains stable when combined with
   LocalRoot functionality, other implementations MAY be used.

   If a local copy of the IANA root zone data is unavailable for use in
   DNS resolution at any point in these steps, resolvers SHOULD fall
   back to performing DNS resolution by issuing queries directly to the
   RSS instead.  If a resolver is unable to do so, it MUST respond to
   client requests with a SERVFAIL response code.

   1.  The resolver SHOULD use a list of root zone sources identified in
       Section 5.1 for obtaining a copy of the IANA root zone.

   2.  The resolver MUST select one of the available sources from step
       1, and from it retrieve a current copy of the IANA root zone.
       Resolvers SHOULD prioritize sources they can fetch the most
       efficiently.  For example, when supported, https sources should
       be preferred as it allows for compression negotiation as well as
       the possibility of using low-cost, well-distributed CDNs to
       distribute the zone files.  When querying a source of IANA root
       zone data, the resolver SHOULD minimize impact to the source by
       querying at a rate no faster than specified by the SOA refresh
       timer and SHOULD use data freshness protocol checks over
       downloading the entire contents at each refresh (example checks
       include the HEAD method [RFC9110] when using HTTP(s) or by
       querying the root zone's SOA over DNS first when using AXFR, IXFR
       or XoT).  Once fetched, an implementation MUST NOT make use of an
       obtained IANA root zone with a SOA serial number less than any
       previously obtained copy [RFC1982].

   3.  If the resolver failed to retrieve the IANA root zone content in
       step 2, or the zone content's serial number was deemed to be
       older than an already cached copy then it SHOULD attempt to
       retrieve the IANA root zone from another source on that list if
       there are other available sources from available sources from
       step 1.  If the resolver has exhausted the list of sources, it
       SHOULD stop attempting to download the IANA root zone and wait
       another refresh time length until retrying all of the sources
       again.

   4.  Having successfully downloaded a copy of the IANA root zone, the
       resolver MUST verify the contents of the IANA root zone using the
       ZONEMD [RFC8976] record contained within it.  Note that this
       REQUIRES verification of the ZONEMD record using DNSSEC [BCP237]
       and the configured IANA root zone trust anchor.  The contents of
       the fetched zone MUST NOT be used until after ZONEMD verification
       is complete and successful.  Once the zone data has been verified
       as the IANA root zone, the resolver can begin LocalRoot enabled
       DNS resolution, potentially using the steps defined in
       Section 5.3, Paragraph 1.

   5.  The resolver MUST check the sources in step 1 at a regular
       interval to identify when a new copy of the IANA root zone is
       available.  This internal MAY be configurable and SHOULD default
       to the IANA root zone's current SOA refresh value.  When a
       resolver has detected that a new copy of the IANA root zone is
       available, the resolver SHOULD start at step 1 to obtain a new
       zone.  Resolvers MAY check multiple sources to ensure one source
       has not fallen significantly behind in its copy of the IANA root
       zone.

   Resolvers MUST have an upper limit beyond which if a new copy is not
   available it will revert to using regular DNS queries to the IANA
   root zone instead of continuing to use the previously downloaded
   copy.  If at any point this upper limit has been reached, the
   resolver SHOULD fall back to using regular DNS mechanisms for
   performing DNS resolutions on behalf of its clients.  This upper
   limit value MAY be configurable and SHOULD default to the root zone's
   current SOA expiry value.  Once the LocalRoot implementation's copy
   of the IANA root zone has been successfully refreshed and is no
   longer considered expired, the resolver may resume LocalRoot enabled
   resolution operations.

5.3.  Integrating and serving root zone data during resolution

   Any mechanism that a recursive resolver can use to serve the data
   obtained in Section 5.2 in such a way that it is functionally
   indishinguishable to a client from having followed regular DNS
   resolution processes should be considered an acceptable
   implementation.  Two example implementation descriptions are included
   in the following two subsections.

5.3.1.  Pre-caching the root zone data

   Once the root zone data has been collected and verified as complete
   and correct (Section 5.2), a resolver MAY simply update its cache
   with the newly obtained values.  This functionally entirely
   alleviates the need for sending any (other) DNS requests to the RSS.

5.3.2.  Running a local authoratative copy of the root zone in parallel

   [RFC8806] described an implementation mechanism where a copy of the
   root zone could be run in an authoratative server running in parallel
   to the recursive resolver.  The recursive resolver could then be
   configured to simply point at this parallel server for obtaining data
   related to the root zone instead of the RSS itself.  Note that
   [RFC8806] required that the parallel server be running on a loopback
   address and this specification removes that requirement and allows
   the parallel service to run on any address it can legitimately be
   used on.  Note that the server MUST NOT use an address of one of the
   official root server addresses in the root zone.

6.  IANA maintained list of root zone publication points

   WJH:TODO

   This list of IANA root zone data publication points available at TBD-
   URL may be used when downloading and refreshing the root zone data,
   as described in Section 5.2.  Specifically, this IANA DNS root zone
   publication list MAY be used by the resolver software directly, or by
   the operating system a resolver is deployed on, or by a network
   operator when configuring a resolver.

   The contents of the IANA DNS root publication points file MUST
   verified as to its integrity as having come from IANA and MUST be
   verified as complete.

6.1.  root zone publication points

   NOTE: this is but an example format that is expected to spur
   discussions within IETF working groups like DNSOP.  Whether this is a
   list in a simple line-delimited format like below or signed JSON or
   signed PGP or ... is subject to debate.

   The format of the IANA root zone data publication points file will
   consist of two parts, separated by a line containing four dashes and
   a newline ("----\n").  The top section of the file contain a newline
   delimited list of URLs [RFC2056].  The second section, following the
   line containing four dashes, will contain a cryptographic checksum or
   signature.  Note that the format of this file applies to the IANA
   maintained list of root zone publication points, but may or may not
   be a format used by other publication point aggregation lists.

   URLs in the list may include any protocol capable of transferring DNS
   zone data, including HTTPS [RFC9110], AXFR
   [draft-hardaker-dnsop-dns-xfr-scheme], XoT
   [draft-hardaker-dnsop-dns-xfr-scheme], etc.

   Any URLs that reference an unknown transfer protocol SHOULD be
   discarded.  If after filtering the list there are no acceptable list
   elements left, the resolver MUST revert to using regular DNS queries
   to the IANA root zone instead of operating as a LocalRoot.

   The first line of the cryptograhpic checksum section will contain a
   checksum or signature type string specifying what the remaining lines
   in the checksum or signature section will contain.

   An minimal example publication point file, containing only a single
   AXFR publication point of b.root-servers.net:

   axfr:b.root-servers.net/.
   ----
   SHA256
   67d687eb21e59321dbb8115c51d1b4ddbd6634362859d130ed77b47a4410656c

6.2.  Publication point operational considerations

   Implementations SHOULD optimize retrieval to minimize impacts on the
   server.  Because the list is not expected to change frequently,
   implementations SHOULD refrain from querying the IANA source more
   than once a week.

7.  Operational Considerations

   TBD

8.  Security Considerations

   There are areas of potential concern that are mitigated to some
   extent by using this mechanism.

8.1.  Leakage of potentially sensitive information

   One privacy concern with the use of DNS is the leakage of potentially
   sensitive information that may be contained in the query name used in
   DNS queries.  Most root servers (except b.root-servers.net) do not
   currently support queries over encrypted transports, resulting in
   query names that are visible to on-the-wire eavesdroppers, and may
   also be held in any operational logs maintained by root server
   operators.  Such concerns may be mitigated by Query Name Minimization
   [RFC9156], but common implementations of this mechanism appear to
   only minimize query names of four or fewer labels, and the uptake
   rate of query name minimization appears to be quite low [QNAMEMIN].
   Furthermore, even with Query Name Minimization, queries for non-
   existent names (generated from keyword searches and mis-
   configurations) can cause additional privacy leaks.  [RFC8806]
   eliminates the need for the resolver to perform specific queries to
   any root nameserver, and obviates any such consideration of query
   name leakage [LOCALROOTPRIVACY].

8.2.  Local resiliency of the DNS

   Another issue solved with LocalRoot is that when information is
   always available locally, usage of it is no longer subject to DDoS
   attacks against the remote servers.  By having the answers
   effectively permanently in cache, no queries to the upstream service
   provider (such as root servers) are needed since [RFC8806] resolvers
   effectively always have a cached set of data that is considered fresh
   longer than the typical TTL records within the zone [CACHEME]
   [LOCALROOTPRIVACY].

9.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: describe the request for IANA to support a list of root server
   publication points at TBD-URL.
